      <p class="text-fluid">Portland Young Writers Workshops are built around one-on-one collaborative hour-long sessions designed to help kids read better and tell stories well through exploration of the imagination. With the creative process and
        story analysis, students are better equipped to think critically about the narratives that structure our society, beliefs, and values. They also learn to empower their own voice through storytelling.</p>

        <h1 class="section-heading">Personalized Mentorships for One or Two Students</h1>
        <p class="text-fluid">Stories are like math; they are a creative formula. Throughout the workshops, kids learn about classical story structure, internal story logic, sequencing, creating dramatic tension, defining stakes. Students also learn
          characterization, theme, genre, point of view, and subject-verb agreement. A story is as much an invention as it is a discovery, and myriad teachable moments arise spontaneously within any given workshop.
          <br /><br />
          Through model texts, Young Writers begin by learning patterns within classical storytelling. We dissect simple texts, learning how writers use reversals to thrust a plot forward. We then move on to the development of the student writer’s
          own original work.
          <br /><br />
          My workshops are highly collaborative. Students and the instructor are in a constant dialog about the story at hand. Workshops are developed and structured by the instructor with the individual student in mind, so that any writer at any
          level can continue to move forward.
          <br /><br />
          As a school teacher, I have read enough student work to understand that writing curriculums in use are not created by those that understand the fluidity of the creative process. Rarely do these curriculums mirror the advice of professional
          writers or my personal experience creating stories, films, playing music, etc. Instead of focusing explicitly on test preparation, Young Writers Workshops draw deeply from the well of literature and film itself, along with the academic
          realm of creative writing.

      <img class="about-seth-image" src="images/sethResized.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="text-fluid"> I am a professional educator with fifteen years experience working and teaching in public schools. After studying creative writing at Florida State University, I went on to earn a Masters in Education from
        Portland State University. I have worked in public schools for fifteen years, and for many of those years as a teacher in Portland Public Schools. More recently, I taught second grade for seven years at Portland's Richmond Elementary School, renouned for it Japanese/American dual language immersion program. Additionally, I create independent films. My first feature, The Jeopardy Story debuted at _________ Film Festival in _____.
        <br /><br />
        With Portland Young Writers Workshops, I teach students different creative methods so that they can develop not only as a writer, but as a person. I sincerely believe that gaining a grasp on the creative writing process gives children an incredible tool that with effort and dedication, can open extraordinary intellectual possibilities within.
